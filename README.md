# nyc-airbnb-datamining
üèòÔ∏è Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Our dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, New York for 2019. 


üóΩ Throughout this project, our primary objective is to uncover meaningful patterns within the New York City AirBnb dataset. We are aiming to uncover patterns related to geographical data, pricing, and reviews in order to identify trends, popular regions, and potential correlations. Correlations are a key aspect of our project, since we will be using exploratory data analysis to understand how various factors within the dataset influence each other. 


Our main question then becomes how do we apply these findings to the New York City AirBnb market in a meaningful way? We want to focus on 3 to 4 major areas, including 

 ‚Ä¢ what we learn about different hosts, areas, locations, prices, and reviews
 
 ‚Ä¢ we can also analyze which hosts are the busiest and why, which will allow us to provide insights that might reveal secrets about the New York Airbnb market
 
 ‚Ä¢ we could analyze if there are any noticeable differences in traffic among different areas and what the reason could be for these differences, and how that impacts AirBnb bookings in New York.


üí°Our findings will be valuable to hosts and guests and contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of short-term rental platforms such as AirBnb.
